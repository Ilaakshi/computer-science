<p style="text-align:center">This foundation's top priority has always been the physical and emotional well-being of our dogs. We work outside of our limits to shower our pups with indescribable love!</p>




<p style="text-align:center"> Our dogs come in from all over Tamil Nadu, we are an open shelter to all! We thoroughly look after our dogs as their health is the most important thing to us. We feed them, bathe them, shelter them, it's a never-ending saga of pampering and love for them! All of our staff members are more than dog-friendly, we've each had our own experience with a lost pup who needed taking care of. </p>
